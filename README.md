# QR Code Generator with Node.js and Express

This is a simple Node.js application that uses Express to create a web server that converts a URL into a QR code image and serves it as a response.

## Getting Started

To run this application, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. After cloning the repository, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install

Make sure to successfully install the following Node.js packages:

express - A web application framework for Node.js.
qrcode - Library for generating QR codes.
sharp - Image processing library for Node.js.

Usage
Start the server by running:

npm start
The server will run on port 3000 by default, or you can specify a different port using the PORT environment variable.

Access the QR code generator by visiting http://localhost:3000/convert?url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-tanwar-6548b71a7/ in your web browser, replacing YOUR_URL with the URL you want to convert to a QR code.

The QR code image will be displayed in your browser.
